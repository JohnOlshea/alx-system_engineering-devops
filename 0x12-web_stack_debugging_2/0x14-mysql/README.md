5. MySQL backup
What if the data center where both your primary and replica database servers are hosted are down because of a power outage or even worse: flooding, fire? Then all your data would inaccessible or lost. That’s why you want to backup and store them in a different system in another physical location. This can be achieved by dumping your MySQL data, compressing them and storing them in a different data center.

Write a Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it.

Requirements:

The MySQL dump must contain all your MySQL databases
The MySQL dump must be named backup.sql
The MySQL dump file has to be compressed to a tar.gz archive
This archive must have the following name format: day-month-year.tar.gz
The user to connect to the MySQL database must be root
The Bash script accepts one argument that is the password used to connect to the MySQL database
